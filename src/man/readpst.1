.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBreadpst\fR is a program that can read an Outlook PST (Personal Folders) file and convert it into an mbox file, a format suitable for KMail, a recursive mbox structure, or separate emails\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-D
Include deleted items in the output\&.

.TP
\-M
Output messages in MH (rfc822) format as separate files\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email together with any attachments into its own file\&. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros\&.

.TP
\-S
Output messages into separate files\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put each email in its own file\&. These files will be numbered from 1 to n with no leading zeros\&. So the email contents for message $m are saved in a file named $m\&. Attachments will also be saved in the same folder as the email message\&. The attachments for message $m are saved as $m\-$name where $name is (the original name of the attachment, or 'attach$n' if the attachment had no name), where $n is another sequential index with no leading zeros\&.

.TP
\-V
Show program version and exit\&.

.TP
\-b
Do not save the attachments for the RTF format of the email body\&.

.TP
\-c \fIformat\fR
Set the Contact output mode\&. Use \-cv for vcard format or \-cl for an email list\&.

.TP
\-d \fIdebug\-file\fR
Specify name of debug log file\&. The log file is now an ascii file, instead of the binary file used in previous versions\&.

.TP
\-e
Same as the M option, but each output file will include an extension from (\&.eml, \&.ics, \&.vcf)\&.

.TP
\-h
Show summary of options and exit\&.

.TP
\-j \fIjobs\fR
Specifies the maximum number of parallel jobs\&. Specify 0 to suppress running parallel jobs\&.

.TP
\-k
Changes the output format to KMail\&.

.TP
\-o \fIoutput\-directory\fR
Specifies the output directory\&. The directory must already exist, and is entered after the PST file is opened, but before any processing of files commences\&.

.TP
\-q
Changes to silent mode\&. No feedback is printed to the screen, except for error messages\&.

.TP
\-r
Changes the output format to Recursive\&. This will create folders as named in the PST file, and will put all emails in a file called "mbox" inside each folder\&. These files are then compatible with all mbox\-compatible email clients\&.

.TP
\-t \fIoutput\-type\-codes\fR
Specifies the item types that are processed\&. The argument is a sequence of single letters from (e,a,j,c) for (email, appointment, journal, contact) types\&. The default is to process all item types\&.

.TP
\-u
Sets Thunderbird mode, a submode of recursive mode\&. This causes two extra \&.type and \&.size meta files to be created\&.

.TP
\-w
Overwrite any previous output files\&. Beware: When used with the \-S switch, this will remove all files from the target folder before writing\&. This is to keep the count of emails and attachments correct\&.
